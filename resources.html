                <h3>What is Sports Betting?</h3>

                <p class="sectionContent">
                    Sports betting is a form of gambling where the goal is to predict the outcome of a game more accurately than those setting the lines at a sports book. This can be nearly impossible as sports books use their vast resources to predict the outcome of a game as well and add on what is known as a vig. 
                </p>

                <h3>What is Moneyline Betting?</h3>

                <p class="sectionContent">
                    Bettr focuses on moneyline sports betting. Moneyline sports betting is simply predicting who will win or lose a game. It does not predict how much one will win or lose by which is known as spread betting.
                </p>

                <h3>How do I Read a Spread?</h3>

                <p class="sectionContent">
                    You may have read spreads such as +150 or -300. What do these mean? The key to sports betting is assigning a probability or percentage to the outcome of a game. Think a game is dead even? Each team has a 50% chance of winning? Think one team is favored? Maybe you’ll assign a 75% chance of winning to them. Spreads are another way of representing these percentages. -300 means that a team is expected to win 3 times for every 1 time it loses. +150 means a team is expected to to lose 1.5 times for every 1 time it wins. You can use bet screening calculator by clicking on a game to see what spread you should take for a given probability.
                </p>

                <h3>How much does the spread payout?</h3>

                <p class="sectionContent">
                    Positive spreads, such as +150, will pay out $150 for every $100 bet. With negative spreads, such as -300, you must bet $300 to win an additional $100. Teams with negative spreads are favorites, and teams with positive spreads are underdogs. The larger the spread, the bigger a favorite or underdog a team is.
                </p>

                <h2 id="section2" class="sectionTitle">Making Money</h2>

                <h3>How Sportsbooks Make Money</h3>

                <p class="sectionContent">
                    Sportsbooks make money by using their vast resources to predict the outcome of a game and then adding a vig. A vig is a way of boosting the odds by percentage to ensure a sportsbook makes money. For example, Let’s say a team is 60% favored to win a game. The odds would be expected to be -150 / +150. If you look at the actual odds, however, they could be -150 / + 130. The odds for the underdog have been boosted higher than they should be! In this case the sports book is earning roughly 3.5% by not giving fair odds. This is what people mean when they say gambling at casinos or sports betting is rigged.
                </p>

                <h3>How To Make Money</h3>

                <p class="sectionContent">
                    We make money by predicting the percent chance of a team winning or losing more accurate than the sports book. This is nearly impossible to do. For example, if we have a sophisticated statistical computer model that we know is correct and it assigns an 80% change of a team winning a game, but the sports book only has the spread set at -200 (66.7%), we should take that bet. Although we might get unlucky on a single bet, over time we will be profitable. You can select a game to use our bet screening tool and use our pre-calculated percentage created by combining multiple computer models from the web or even enter your own. 
                </p>

                <h3>Sport to Sport Differences</h3>


                <p class="sectionContent">
                    Some sports are more predictable than others. Less predictable sports generally have win probabilities closer to 50% whereas more predictable sports such as basketball have win probabilities closer to 100%. The video below explores the differences in predictability between sports. In some sports it is more common to bet based on the score, number of points scored, or other metrics rather than just who will win or lose. Bettr currently focuses on NBA basketball.

                <h2 id="section3" class="sectionTitle">Sustainable Strategies</h2>

                <h3>Making Bets with Positive Expected Values</h3>

                <p class="sectionContent">
                    Expected value is a concept in statistics. It asks, what would be the average outcome if we made this a bet an infinite number of times. Our bet screening calculator works on this principal. An individual bet may be unlucky and lose money, but if you repeatedly make bets with positive expected values you are expected to win over time.
                </p>

                <h3>Shopping the Line</h3>

                <p class="sectionContent">
                    Different sports books have different lines set so it can be advantageous to compare lines from book to book. 
                </p>

                <h3>Bet Sizing</h3>

                <p class="sectionContent">
                    Bet sizing is a more advanced topic with multiple methods available. The general idea is to bet more when you are more sure of the outcome (bets with large expected values) and bet less when you are less sure of the outcome. The following video summarizes this page and provides additional information. If you want to speed through the video you can start at 4:16.

                <h3>Betting Sustainably</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Place bets 48 hours before a game if possible. This reduces the impulsive last minute nature and leads to calmer, more rational betting and prevents tilting. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set a limit on how much you will bet each pay period as a percentage of your income. This can put a limit to out of control betting. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Know that gambling addiction has a hereditary risk. If you have an addictive personality or others in your family do, you can have a higher than average chance at developing gambling addiction.
                    </li>
                    <li>Don’t rely on betting to generate income. Betting can be fun, but it is nearly impossible to generate sustainable income from gambling and sports betting. This is due to the vig set by books as mentioned in the previous section.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Know how much you have bet. When placing multiple bets over time it can become easy to lose track. Be aware of how much you have spent and how much you have lost or made over time. Check this number periodically and keep it in mind.               
                    </li>
                    <li>Use Bettr. Select a game to screen you bet before placing it and compare what you think the win percentage of a game is to statistical computer models across the web.</li>
                </ol>

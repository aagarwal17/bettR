bettr provides users with betting information and education tools.
## Project Vision
With the legalization of sports betting many sports fans are putting their money where their mouth is for the first time. Most users lose money, however, due to following useless heuristics or pundits. bettr's aim is to create a web dashboard displaying the current spreads for sports games along with models from multiple publicly available sites side-by-side with their relative historical performances. Users can enter their bets and receive their expected payout/loss and break even point. bettr allows users to have statistically informed insight into their betting and help society mitigate the negative externalities of betting through education.
